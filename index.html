      GOS (Geometric Optics Simulator) provides a simple but powerfull framework to perform little experiments based on the laws os what is known as "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_optics">geometric optics</a>".
      GOS is fully developed using Javascript and runs in your browser so it doesn't require downloading any executable or install anything.

      <b>Tips</b>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>All angular magnitudes are in degrees. All length magnitudes are in the same units, which can be whatever you want (m, cm, mm, etc). The scale doesn't affect the solution.</li>
        <li>You can enable/disable a background grid and snap elements to grid in the lower right corner.</li>
        <li>After selecting an element, you can delete it pressing X or clone it pressing C.</li>
        <li>With an element selected, you can use the mouse wheel to rotate the element.</li>
        <li>In the top bar you can save your results and download the file. </li>
        <li>You can load previous results, first select the file you want to upload and then click on "Load File".</li>
        <li>When loading a previous result, if the "Additive Mode" is enabled, the elements will be added the current simulation.</li>
        <li>You can also download your simulation as a PNG, to do so click on the "Export PNG" button.</li>
        <li>Thick Lenses are expensive and you might experience some delays. If that happens, try to reduce the number of rays in the sources.</li>
      </ul>

      <b>List of features currently supported (v1.2):</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Two different light sources with custom number of rays (point light and colimated beam)
        <li>Ideal thin lenses (converging and diverging)
        <li>Flat and curved (spherical) mirrors</li>
        <li>Higly customizable thick lenses with all possible combinations of flat/convex/concave surfaces.</li>
        <li>Rule and portractor to make measurements</li>
        <li>Save/Load your simulation results.</li>
        <li>Export simulation results as imagenes (png)</li>
      </ul>
