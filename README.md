# GOS (Geometric Optic Simulator)

From Wikipedia (Gemetrical Optics:
Geometrical optics, or ray optics, is a model of optics that describes light propagation in terms of rays. 
The ray in geometric optics is an abstraction useful for approximating the paths along which light propagates under certain circumstances.

GOS provides basic elements and types of light sources and calculate the ray trajectory in real time.
GOS is developed in Javascript and runs enterile in the web browswer.
